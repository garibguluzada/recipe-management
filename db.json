      "ingredients": "500g beef sirloin or tenderloin (cut into thin strips),\n1 onion (finely chopped),\n2 cloves garlic (minced),\n200g mushrooms (sliced),\n1 cup beef broth,\n1 tbsp Dijon mustard,\n1/2 cup sour cream,\n2 tbsp butter,\n1 tbsp olive oil,\nSalt (to taste),\nFreshly ground black pepper (to taste),\n2 tbsp flour (optional, for thickening),\nFresh parsley (chopped, for garnish),\n300g egg noodles or rice (for serving).",
      "steps": "Cook the noodles: Start by cooking the egg noodles or rice according to package instructions. Drain and set aside. Brown the beef: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat. Season the beef strips with salt and pepper, then brown them in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side until the beef is browned but not fully cooked through. Remove the beef and set aside. Sauté the onions and garlic: In the same skillet, melt the remaining butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 4 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 1 minute until fragrant. Cook the mushrooms: Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes until they release their moisture and become golden brown. Prepare the sauce: Stir in the Dijon mustard and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the sauce to reduce slightly. If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can stir in 2 tablespoons of flour at this stage and cook for another 2 minutes. Finish the sauce: Lower the heat and stir in the sour cream. Mix well until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. Return the beef to the skillet and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, until the beef is cooked through and tender. Serve: Season the Stroganoff with additional salt and pepper if needed. Serve over the cooked egg noodles or rice, and garnish with freshly chopped parsley.",
